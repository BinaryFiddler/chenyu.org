It has been in my plan for the longest time to have a personal website. The idea was there the moment I learnt about the web technologies while I was still in college back in 2015. Over the years,I did at least 4 different mock ups, all with different technologies over the years, but ultimately never published any of them. It's like I have these grand visions that everything has to be perfect before I go live. I wanted every little detail, color scheme, font sizes, performance, mobile compatibility, content quality to be as good as it can before sharing it. I was starting a personal blog as if a little girl is planning for her perfect wedding day. 

Fast forward to today, before I finally published this first piece of writing, I went over at least 3 different web technologies, constantly building something just to tear it down soon after. After I finally settled on the technical side of things, I dawdled for months on how to start and what I should post. I realize my timidity for progress is rooted in a subconscious fear for failure, not just the initial failure, but also the potential of eventual failure after much time and effort have been spent.

I was brought up in a mindset that failure is not acceptable, while it is not that we will never encounter obstacles, but everything we do must result in its eventual triumph. The emphasis is always on overcoming the failure, every heroic tale and aspiring story we read dramatize the difficulty the protagonist has to endure, while even more so emphasizes the significance of his or her eventual triumph. We were taught to overcome failure, not to live with it.

Yet the truth is, it is completely okay to fail as long as we are learning something from it. When I was preparing for violin performances at my teacher’s quarterly recitals, I was never truly ready. Every time I tried to run through the piece, there were always something amiss. One time it was the intonation of a couple of notes, the other time was miscounting some rhythms. If it was up to me to decide when I was ready, I would have never performed. Yet the date is set, and I did perform. I was so nervous the first time, I had even more intonation problems, miscounted even more rhythms than I did in the dry-run. I even forgot to tighten my bow and played through the entire piece with a flappy bow. It was terrible, but it was ok. The silly but important lesson I learnt from that day was: always check my bow hair before playing. I never performed with a flappy bow ever again.

No matter how hard we try, we can never truly be fully prepared. In the end, it is more important to actually do the thing we want to do than holding back because we fear it might not be perfect. As the founder of the building a second brain movement Tiago Forte said in his book:

> Don’t wait until something is complete or perfect to share it. You may be waiting forever because it never will be.

Strive for perfection, learn from mistakes, live with failures, then just try again.
